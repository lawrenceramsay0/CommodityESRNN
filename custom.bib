	abstract = {Data breaches are not only on the increase but firms struggle to detect, defend and respond to such breaches. A data breach opens a period of crisis for the affected firm, generates complex information, and requires providing information to a variety of stakeholders in a timely and proper manner. This article reports one of the first studies on the impact of social media exposure by affected firms on stock price reaction to a data breach announcement. Using an event study methodology on a sample of 87 data breaches from 73 {US} publicly-traded firms from 2011 to 2014, we find that use of social media exposure at the time of a data breach exacerbates the negative stock price to the announcement. Interestingly, we find that this negative association is contingent on traditional media visibility; the effect is positive for low-visibility companies. Based on our results, we posit that there is a need for a contingency model for social media communication during firm crises and such a model should be based at least on firm size, visibility and the type of crisis.},

	shorttitle = {{ES}-{dRNN}},
	abstract = {Short-term load forecasting ({STLF}) is challenging due to complex time series ({TS}) which express three seasonal patterns and a nonlinear trend. This paper proposes a novel hybrid hierarchical deep learning model that deals with multiple seasonality and produces both point forecasts and predictive intervals ({PIs}). It combines exponential smoothing ({ES}) and a recurrent neural network ({RNN}). {ES} extracts dynamically the main components of each individual {TS} and enables on-the-ﬂy deseasonalization, which is particularly useful when operating on a relatively small data set. A multi-layer {RNN} is equipped with a new type of dilated recurrent cell designed to efﬁciently model both short and long-term dependencies in {TS}. To improve the internal {TS} representation and thus the model’s performance, {RNN} learns simultaneously both the {ES} parameters and the main mapping function transforming inputs into forecasts. We compare our approach against several baseline methods, including classical statistical methods and machine learning ({ML}) approaches, on {STLF} problems for 35 European countries. The empirical study clearly shows that the proposed model has high expressive power to solve nonlinear stochastic forecasting problems with {TS} including multiple seasonality and signiﬁcant random ﬂuctuations. In fact, it outperforms both statistical and state-of-the-art {ML} models in terms of accuracy.},

In this paper, we investigate whether the daily number of tweets that mention Standard \& Poor 500 (S\&P 500) stocks is correlated with S\&P 500 stock indicators (stock price and traded volume) at three diﬀerent levels, from the stock market to industry sector and individual company stocks. We further apply a linear regression with exogenous input model to predict stock market indicators, using Twitter data as exogenous input. Our preliminary results demonstrate that daily number of tweets is correlated with certain stock market indicators at each level. Furthermore, it appears that Twitter is helpful to predict stock market. Speciﬁcally, at the stock market level, we ﬁnd that whether S\&P 500 closing price will go up or down can be predicted more accurately when including Twitter data in the model.},

	abstract = {Microblogging is a form of online communication by which users broadcast brief text updates, also known as tweets, to the public or a selected circle of contacts. A variegated mosaic of microblogging uses has emerged since the launch of Twitter in 2006: daily chatter, conversation, information sharing, and news commentary, among others. Regardless of their content and intended use, tweets often convey pertinent information about their author’s mood status. As such, tweets can be regarded as temporally-authentic microscopic instantiations of public mood state. In this article, we perform a sentiment analysis of all public tweets broadcasted by Twitter users between August 1 and December 20, 2008. For every day in the timeline, we extract six dimensions of mood (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) using an extended version of the Proﬁle of Mood States ({POMS}), a well-established psychometric instrument. We compare our results to ﬂuctuations recorded by stock market and crude oil price indices and major events in media and popular culture, such as the U.S. Presidential Election of November 4, 2008 and Thanksgiving Day. We ﬁnd that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have a signiﬁcant, immediate and highly speciﬁc eﬀect on the various dimensions of public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a solid platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive value with regards to existing social as well as economic indicators.},

Zapart, On entropy, ﬁnancial markets and minority games, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 388 (7) 2009, pages 1157-1172). The research builds upon an earlier statistical analysis of ﬁnancial time series with Shannon information entropy, published in (Molgedey, L and Ebeling, W, 2000, “Local order, entropy and predictability of ﬁnancial time series”, European Physical Journal B - Condensed Matter and Complex Systems). A novel generic procedure is proposed for making multistep-ahead predictions of time series by building a statistical model of entropy. The approach is applied to the prediction of Japanese Yen/{US} dollar intraday currency exchange time series. The study also reinterprets the Minority Game (Moro E, 2004, “The Minority Game: an introductory guide”, Advances in Condensed Matter and Statistical Physics) within the context of physical entropy, and uses models derived from minority game theory as a tool for measuring the entropy of a model in response to time series. This entropy conditional upon a model is subsequently used in place of information-theoretic entropy in the proposed multistep prediction algorithm.},

The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were ‘‘combinations’’ of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a ‘‘hybrid’’ approach that utilized both statistical and {ML} features. This method’s average {sMAPE} was close to 10\% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one {ML} one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a {ML} algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95\% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure {ML} methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naïve2. This paper presents some initial results of M4, its major findings and a logical conclusion. Finally, it outlines what the authors consider to be the way forward for the field of forecasting.},

	title = {Assessing Oil Market Overbought and Oversold with Neural Networks},
	abstract = {Background: The price reporting agency sponsoring this research – Argus Media (Argus) – maintains a predictive data science product called ‘Argus Possibility Curves’ which utilises a {GAMLSS} statistical model to forecast prices for crude oil and refined products. These forecasts are used by trading firms to hedge money on the commodity markets. Before the {APC} forecast is sent to clients, it is quality controlled against the overbought and oversold methodology to understand if successful trades can be made. 
Purpose: Argus are looking to find out if neural networks could be used to predict the {OBOS} level and if they could potentially be more accurate than existing processes.
Method: The {APC} data was run through a selection of temporal neural networks and compared against each other and compared to a naive model. The accuracy of their prediction was then assessed to see if they could make successful trades.
Result: The neural networks easily outperformed the naive model and the {LSTM} and {GRU} models were the overall top performers in {OBOS} prediction. The {RNN} outperformed the {LSTM} and {GRU} in one category of {OBOS} prediction.},

We compare the forecast accuracy of these models against appropriate benchmarks, including {TBATS}, Poisson Regression, Prophet, and simple empirical distribution. We use Root Mean Squared Error to examine the point forecast accuracy and assess the forecast distribution accuracy using Quantile Bias, {PinBall} Score and Pinball Skill Score. Our results indicate that the proposed models outperform their benchmarks. Our developed models can also be general­ ised to other services, such as hospitals, ambulances or clinical desk services.},

	abstract = {This article introduces this {JBR} Special Issue on simple versus complex methods in forecasting. Simplicity in forecasting requires that (1) method, (2) representation of cumulative knowledge, (3) relationships in models, and (4) relationships among models, forecasts, and decisions are all sufﬁciently uncomplicated as to be easily understood by decision-makers. Our review of studies comparing simple and complex methods – including those in this special issue – found 97 comparisons in 32 papers. None of the papers provide a balance of evidence that complexity improves forecast accuracy. Complexity increases forecast error by 27 percent on average in the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons. The ﬁnding is consistent with prior research to identify valid forecasting methods: all 22 previously identiﬁed evidence-based forecasting procedures are simple. Nevertheless, complexity remains popular among researchers, forecasters, and clients. Some evidence suggests that the popularity of complexity may be due to incentives: (1) researchers are rewarded for publishing in highly ranked journals, which favor complexity; (2) forecasters can use complex methods to provide forecasts that support decisionmakers’ plans; and (3) forecasters’ clients may be reassured by incomprehensibility. Clients who prefer accuracy should accept forecasts only from simple evidence-based procedures. They can rate the simplicity of forecasters’ procedures using the questionnaire at simple-forecasting.com.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of the selection of multivariate generalized autoregressive heteroskedastic ({GARCH}) models in terms of variance matrix forecasting accuracy, with a particul relatively large-scale problems. We consider 10 assets from the New York Stock Exchange and co models based 1-, 5- and 20-day-ahead conditional variance forecasts over a period of 10 years using confidence set ({MCS}) and the superior predictive ability ({SPA}) tests. Model performance is evalua four statistical loss functions which account for different types and degrees of asymmetry with res /under-predictions. When considering the full sample, {MCS} results are strongly driven by short peri market instability during which multivariate {GARCH} models appear to be inaccurate. Over relative periods, i.e. the dot-com bubble, the set of superior models is composed of sophisticated specificat orthogonal and dynamic conditional correlation ({DCC}), both with leverage effect in the conditiona However, unlike the {DCC} models, our results show that the orthogonal specifications tend to un the conditional variance. Over calm periods, a simple assumption like constant conditional corr symmetry in the conditional variances cannot be rejected. Finally, during the 2007-2008 finan accounting for non-stationarity in the conditional variance process generates superior forecasts. T suggests that, independently from the period, the best models do not provide significantly better fo the {DCC} model of Engle (2002, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20: 339-350) with the conditional variances of the returns.

	abstract = {Time series modeling has entered an era of unprecedented growth in the size and complexity of data which require new modeling approaches. While many new general purpose machine learning approaches have emerged (Bayer, 2015; Graves, 2013; Pascanu et al., 2012), they remain poorly understand and irreconcilable with more traditional statistical modeling approaches (Box and Jenkins, 1976; Hamilton, 1994). We present a general class of exponential smoothed recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) which are well suited to modeling non-stationary dynamical systems arising in industrial applications. In particular, we analyze their capacity to characterize the non-linear partial autocorrelation structure of time series and directly capture dynamic eﬀects such as seasonality and trends. Application of exponentially smoothed {RNNs} to forecasting electricity load, weather data, and stock prices highlight the eﬃcacy of exponential smoothing of the hidden state for multi-step time series forecasting. The results also suggest that popular, but more complicated neural network architectures originally designed for speech processing, such as {LSTMs} and {GRUs}, are likely over-engineered for industrial forecasting and light-weight exponentially smoothed architectures, trained in a fraction of the time, capture the salient features while being superior and more robust than simple {RNNs} and {ARIMA} models. Additionally uncertainty quantiﬁcation of the exponential smoothed recurrent neural networks, provided by Bayesian estimation, is shown to provide improved coverage.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that commodity prices can be predicted from cross-market information by establishing long-run cross-market commodity price equilibrium models, which are characterized by a linear relation between prices across different markets. Using data from ﬁve representative commodity markets (oil, copper, gold, corn, and cattle) during the period 2005–2018, we demonstrate that oil and industrial metal markets have formed a longrun price equilibrium with other markets across different commodity families. However, agriculture and gold markets do not tend to have long-run price equilibrium relations with other commodity markets. Furthermore, we show that the absence of a price equilibrium is due to the cross-market liquidity interference effect. After we control for the liquidity effect, long-run cross-market commodity price equilibrium relations are reestablished for agriculture and gold markets. These results can aid in demonstrating that liquidity can capture most of the missing information that is not reﬂected in price dynamics in less liquid markets, such as agriculture and gold markets. Therefore, less liquid commodity price predictions require both prices and liquidity levels from cross-markets, while liquid commodity prices (oil and metal) can be predicted based solely on cross-market prices.},

The information space corresponding to stocks is divided into the network public opinion space O pinion\_Space and the realistic transaction space Behavior \_Space. We then handle the information and generate the multidimensional time series from them respectively. Furthermore, Granger causality analysis and information theory measures are used to ﬁnd and demonstrate that social media sentiments contain statistically signiﬁcant ex-ante information on the future prices.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the current state of the art and synthesize the published literature related to the financial sentiment analysis, especially in investor sentiment for prediction of stock price. Starting from this overview the paper provides answers to the questions about how and to what extent research on investor sentiment analysis and stock price trend forecasting in the financial markets has developed and which tools are used for these purposes remains largely unexplored. This paper represents the comprehensive literature-based study on the fields of the investors sentiment analytics and machine learning applied to analyzing the sentiment of investors and its influencing stock market and predicting stock price.},

	abstract = {Forecasts are crucial for practically all economic and business decisions. However, there is a mounting body of empirical evidence showing that accurate forecasting in the economic and business world is usually not possible. In addition, there is huge uncertainty, as practically all economic and business activities are subject to events we are unable to predict. The fact that forecasts can be inaccurate creates a serious dilemma for decision and policy makers. On the one hand, accepting the limits of forecasting accuracy implies being unable to assess the correctness of decisions and the surrounding uncertainty. On the other hand, believing that accurate forecasts are possible means succumbing to the illusion of control and experiencing surprises, often with negative consequences. We believe that the time has come for a new attitude towards dealing with the future. In this article, we discuss the limited predictability in the economic and business environment. We also provide a framework that allows decision and policy makers to face the future — despite the inherent limitations of forecasting and the uncertainty, sometimes huge, surrounding most future-oriented decisions.},

Even though sales managers have been called to serve as a profound base for business forecasts from a theoretical perspective, this premise has not been subject to empirical testing to date. Addressing this research void, the authors analyze under which conditions sales managers’ business forecasts are reliable and when not. The authors conducted a cross-industry field study including two measurement points with 180 high-ranking senior sales managers. Results show that managers’ forecast accuracy fundamentally depends on contextual moderators. Sales managers predict future business situations 2.5 times more accurate when they exhibit a long firm-specific experience and high confidence-levels in their own forecast. Furthermore, a comparably long sales cycle improves forecast accuracy. Conversely, sales managers may make considerable misjudgments if the before mentioned conditions are not met.},

	title = {Domain Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting via Attention Sharing},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06828},
	abstract = {Recently, deep neural networks have gained increasing popularity in the ﬁeld of time series forecasting. A primary reason for their success is their ability to effectively capture complex temporal dynamics across multiple related time series. The advantages of these deep forecasters only start to emerge in the presence of a sufﬁcient amount of data. This poses a challenge for typical forecasting problems in practice, where there is a limited number of time series or observations per time series, or both. To cope with this data scarcity issue, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework, Domain Adaptation Forecaster ({DAF}). {DAF} leverages statistical strengths from a relevant domain with abundant data samples (source) to improve the performance on the domain of interest with limited data (target). In particular, we use an attention-based shared module with a domain discriminator across domains and private modules for individual domains. We induce domain-invariant latent features (queries and keys) and retrain domain-speciﬁc features (values) simultaneously to enable joint training of forecasters on source and target domains. A main insight is that our design of aligning keys allows the target domain to leverage source time series even with different characteristics. Extensive experiments on various domains demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-theart baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our design choices.},

Therefore, it is very important to ﬁnd a multi factor combination suitable for a particular stock to predict the price of the stock. This paper proposes to use Genetic Algorithm({GA}) for feature selection and develop an optimized Long Short-Term Memory({LSTM}) neural network stock prediction model. Firstly, we use the {GA} to obtain a factors importance ranking. Then, the optimal combination of factors is obtained from this ranking with the method of trial and error. Finally, we use the combination of optimal factors and {LSTM} model for stock prediction. Thorough empirical studies based upon the China construction bank dataset and the {CSI} 300 stock dataset demonstrate that the {GA}-{LSTM} model can outperform all baseline models for time series prediction.},

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller generalpurpose language representation model, called {DistilBERT}, which can then be ﬁnetuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-speciﬁc models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a {BERT} model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},
